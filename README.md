Iâ€™m Salem Domani, a Software engineer and a 4th year student in Syria - Damascus University in ITE college.
I'm passionated about developing 2d games and large systems that needs to squeeze every cell of your brain to get it done, with some perfectionism I tweak code repeatedly trying to make it work perfectly and I always succeed.
